I created this script for personal uses with the pytube library.

Videos will be created in the actual directory "yt-downloader" you have with 
new folders in created by the script. You could change it modifying the 
necessary rows in the code.

1- "output-hq/" for the highest quality videos in ".mp4" extension.
2- "output-lq/" for the lowest quality videos in ".mp4" extension.
3- "output-a/" for the audio in ".mp3" extension.

Videos formats accepted (as I know, maybe could be other ones):
· https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICzJvJpbALk

Playlists formats accepted (as I know, maybe could be other ones):
· https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLba0qjqjWby7Sga35PEcYTahVH3xF3TY2
· https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMkkLQxJOac&list=PLba0qjqjWby7Sga35PEcYTahVH3xF3TY2&index=1

Hope it was useful for you.

Thanks.
